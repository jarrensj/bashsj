Bash is a dogo argentino. 

## Commands

Here is a list of commands that Bash knows. 

- **come here**: *Come here*  
  A command to have Bash come to you. If he is already close to you and you say this again, he will come even closer and closer to you.

- **sitz**: *Sit* (Pronounced as "sits")  
  A command to have Bash sit down.

- **platz**: *Lay down* (Pronounced as "plahts")  
  A command to have Bash lay down. 

- **fuß**: *Heel (to my left side)* (Pronounced as "fooss")  
  When you're walking and want Bash to heel or to come/stay close by your left side, this is the command to use. You can also say it if he is already in heel position but you want him to be even closer by your left side. Perfect if there are obstructions or he is walking not as close to your left side as you want.

- **leave it**: *Leave whatever is in his current focus alone*  
  When you want Bash to leave something alone that he is currently focused on. It might be something he is super sniffing hard on the ground, some item on the ground or that he is approaching, or just anything he is focused on.

- **not your friend**: *It's not time to play*  
  This is usually used when Bash wants to play with another dog but it's not appropriate at the time or area whether you are walking somewhere or at a coffee shop. When you are walking with Bash and he sees other dogs and wants to play with other dogs but want Bash to leave them alone and keep his current task (whether you are currently walking or standing in line somewhere)

- **itadakimasu**: *Eat* (Pronounced as "ee-tah-dah-kee-mahs")  
  Time for a meal? Use this command to let Bash know that it's okay to start eating. 

- **free**: *Free, he can do whatever he wants*   
  Bash is free to roam, play, or rest as he pleases. 

- **wait**: *Wait*   
  Bash to stay put where he is or wait for the command to go free. I use this if I want him to stay put somewhere or if I put a treat in front of him. Good for us right when you come inside the house and then telling him to wait (stay put) until I wipe his body and paws clean. 

- **go to the room**: *Go to ~~my~~ our room*  
  Bash will go to the room that we are sleeping in.

- **go to bed**: *Go to his bed*  
  Bash will go to his bed.

- **go upstairs**: *Go upstairs*  
  Bash will go upstairs.

- **yip yip**: *Get inside the car*  
  Bash will go inside the car. 

- **bang bang**: *Play dead*  
  Bash lays down flat on his side. I usually use this when is already in a laying down position of some sort. You can also just make a gun with your hands and pretend to shoot him. 

- **ándale**: *Increase pace* (Pronounced as "ahn-DAH-leh.")  
  Encourage Bash to pick up the pace with this command, useful during walks or when you're in a bit of a hurry.
